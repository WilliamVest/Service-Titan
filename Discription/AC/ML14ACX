<h3>Designed for efficient durability</h3>
The ML14XC1 air conditioner is designed for smart energy use, and designed to last. Efficiency ratings of up to 17.00 SEER mean the ML14XC1 can reduce utility bills without any compromise in comfort. It may also make you eligible for local utility rebates.
<br/><br/><h3>Dependable performance, even in harsh conditions</h3>

The coil inside an air conditioner helps keep your home cool by pulling the heat out of the air. The Lennox® Quantum™ coil handles the heat like no other. It’s constructed from fortified aluminum alloy, helping it resist corrosion in harsh conditions.
<br/><br/><h3>Proven engineering</h3>
The ML14XC1 is built with a scroll compressor that's engineered to reliably deliver the cooling your home needs.
